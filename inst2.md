# C++ to Python Extension Installation Guide

## User

i have got c++ code i want to use as a python extension. i have got the setup.py aswell as the wheel .whl file on a private company git repository.

i can install the xtension with 'pip install [link to the repository]' which then prompts me for a username and password in vs code.

as far as i understand, pip creates a new venv from the setup.py, compiles the code into a wheel, installs it and then deletes the venv. meaning the user has to have a c++ compiler as well as python3-dev installed in order to compile the code and use the extension, is that correct?

---

## Assistant

Yes, your understanding is mostly correct, but let me clarify the process and requirements:

### Installation Process:
1. When you run `pip install [link-to-repository]`:
    - Pip fetches the package (in this case, your C++ extension source code + `setup.py`)
    - It creates a temporary build environment (not necessarily a full venv)
    - Compiles the C++ code into a Python extension (`.so` on Linux/Mac, `.pyd` on Windows)
    - Packages it into a wheel (`.whl`) if not already provided
    - Installs the compiled extension
    - Cleans up temporary files (but doesn't necessarily delete a full venv)

### Requirements for Installation:
- **C++ Compiler**: Yes, the user needs an appropriate compiler:
    - Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools (MSVC)
    - Linux: `g++` or `clang++`
    - Mac: Xcode command line tools
- **Python Development Headers**: `python3-dev` or equivalent is needed
- **Other Dependencies**: Any libraries your C++ code depends on

### Key Points:
1. If you're distributing via a private repository and already have the `.whl` file:
    - The wheel should be platform-specific (manylinux, win32, etc.)
    - If the wheel is pre-built for the user's platform, they **don't** need a compiler
    - If the wheel isn't pre-built or doesn't match their platform, pip will attempt to build from source

2. Best Practice Solution:
    - Build wheels for all target platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) in CI/CD
    - Upload them to your private repository
    - Users then get the pre-built wheel matching their platform (no compiler needed)

3. Current Situation:
    - If users are being prompted to compile, it means either:
        - No matching wheel exists in your repo for their platform, or
        - They're forcing source installation with `--no-binary`

### Recommendations:
1. To avoid requiring users to have compilers:
   ```bash
   # Build wheels for all platforms in CI/CD and upload to your repo
   python -m pip wheel . -w dist/
   # Or use cibuildwheel for multi-platform builds
   ```

2. If you must have users compile:
    - Document the requirements clearly (specific compiler versions, etc.)
    - Consider using `pyproject.toml` with proper `build-system` requirements

3. For private repos:
    - You can configure pip to always prefer wheels if available:
      ```bash
      pip install --only-binary :all: [your-package]
      ```

The most user-friendly approach is to provide pre-built wheels for all target platforms in your private repository. This way users don't need any development tools installed.

## User

i have the wheel in the dist folder. how do i tell pip to use the wheel and how do i know whether it's the correct wheel?

---

## Assistant

To ensure `pip` uses the correct pre-built wheel from your `dist` folder (and doesn't try to recompile from source), follow these steps:

---

### **1. Install Directly from the Local Wheel**
Run this from the directory containing the `dist` folder:
```bash
pip install ./dist/your_package-version-platform.whl
```
or (if you're in the parent directory):
```bash
pip install path/to/dist/your_package.whl
```

This forces `pip` to use the exact wheel you specify.

---

### **2. Verify the Wheel is Correct**
Check if the wheel matches your system using the **filename conventions**:
A wheel filename looks like this:
```
{package}-{version}-{python tag}-{abi tag}-{platform tag}.whl
```
Example:
```
my_package-1.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
```
- **Python tag**: `cp310` = CPython 3.10
- **ABI tag**: `cp310` = ABI compatibility for CPython 3.10
- **Platform tag**: `win_amd64` = 64-bit Windows

#### **How to Check Compatibility**
Run in Python:
```python
import pip._internal.utils.compatibility_tags as tags
print(tags.get_supported())
```
This lists all supported wheel tags for your system. Your wheel's tags must match one of these.

---

### **3. Force `pip` to Prefer Wheels (If Installing from a Repository)**
If installing from a private repo (not locally), use:
```bash
pip install --only-binary :all: your-package
```
This prevents `pip` from building from source.

---

### **4. Check if the Correct Wheel Was Installed**
After installation, verify:
```bash
pip show your-package
```
Check the `Location` field to confirm the installed version matches your wheel.

---

### **5. Common Issues & Fixes**
| Issue | Solution |
|--------|------------|
| `pip` ignores the wheel and builds from source | Use `--no-deps --force-reinstall --ignore-installed` with the wheel path |
| Wheel is not compatible | Rebuild the wheel for the correct platform (`manylinux`, `win_amd64`, etc.) |
| `pip` downloads from PyPI instead of using local wheel | Use the full local path (`./dist/package.whl`) |

---

### **Best Practice**
- **Build platform-specific wheels** in CI/CD (e.g., using `cibuildwheel`).
- **Upload all wheels** to your private repo so `pip` can choose the right one automatically.

## User

lets say my repository is https://company/git/my_repo, how do i install the wheel which is located in the dist folder?

---

## Assistant

To install the `.whl` file directly from your Git repository's `dist` folder, you'll need to use the **raw URL** to the wheel file. Here's how:

---

### **Method 1: Install Wheel Directly from Git Repository (Raw URL)**
1. **Get the raw URL** of the `.whl` file:
    - Navigate to `https://company/git/my_repo` in your browser.
    - Go to the `dist` folder.
    - Right-click the `.whl` file and copy its **raw URL** (e.g., `https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/my_package-1.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl`).

2. **Install using `pip`**:
   ```bash
   pip install https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/my_package-1.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
   ```
    - If authentication is required, use:
      ```bash
      pip install --user https://username:password@company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/my_package.whl
      ```
      *(Note: Avoid hardcoding passwords; use a `.netrc` file or environment variables instead.)*

---

### **Method 2: Clone the Repo & Install Locally**
If you have Git access:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://company/git/my_repo.git
   cd my_repo
   ```
2. **Install the wheel from `dist`**:
   ```bash
   pip install ./dist/my_package-1.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
   ```

---

### **Method 3: Use `pip install` with Git+URL (For Dev Mode)**
If you want to install directly from Git (but this builds from source unless you specify a wheel):
```bash
pip install git+https://company/git/my_repo.git
```
*(This uses `setup.py`, not the wheel.)*

---

### **How to Verify the Correct Wheel Was Installed**
1. Check the installed package:
   ```bash
   pip show my_package
   ```
    - Look at `Location` to confirm it points to the wheel.

2. List installed files:
   ```bash
   pip list --format=freeze | grep my_package
   ```

---

### **Troubleshooting**
| Issue | Solution |
|--------|------------|
| **`pip` ignores the wheel and builds from source** | Use `--no-deps --force-reinstall --ignore-installed` |
| **Authentication fails** | Use a [`.netrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60312626) or Git credentials helper |
| **Wrong wheel for platform** | Rebuild the wheel with `cibuildwheel` or `manylinux` |

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Pre-build wheels** for all platforms (`win32`, `win_amd64`, `manylinux`, `macosx`).
2. **Upload to a private PyPI server** (e.g., `devpi`, `Artifactory`) instead of Git for better `pip` compatibility.
3. **Use `--find-links`** if hosting wheels in a non-PyPI repo:
   ```bash
   pip install --find-links https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/ my_package
   ```

## User

if i install it via pip install https://username:password@link i get a timeout error

---

## Assistant

If you're getting a **timeout error** when trying to install a wheel directly from your private Git repository using:

```bash
pip install https://username:password@company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/package.whl
```

Here are the likely causes and solutions:

---

### **1. Git Repo Doesn’t Support Raw File Access**
- Some Git servers (like GitLab, Bitbucket, or private GitHub Enterprise) require authentication even for raw file access.
- **Fix:**
    - Use **GitLab/Bitbucket’s API** to download artifacts:
      ```bash
      curl -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_token>" "https://company/api/v4/projects/<id>/packages/generic/my_repo/1.0/package.whl" -o package.whl
      pip install package.whl
      ```
    - Or use `git clone` + local install:
      ```bash
      git clone https://username:password@company/git/my_repo.git
      pip install ./my_repo/dist/package.whl
      ```

---

### **2. Firewall/Proxy Blocking the Connection**
- Corporate networks often block direct HTTP downloads.
- **Fix:**
    - Use `--proxy`:
      ```bash
      pip install --proxy=http://user:pass@corp-proxy:port https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/package.whl
      ```
    - Or try `--trusted-host`:
      ```bash
      pip install --trusted-host company https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/package.whl
      ```

---

### **3. Git Server Rate Limiting**
- If too many requests are made, the server may throttle downloads.
- **Fix:**
    - Use a **personal access token (PAT)** instead of a password:
      ```bash
      pip install https://gitlab+deploy-token-1234:token-here@company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/package.whl
      ```

---

### **4. URL Format Incorrect**
- Some Git servers require a specific URL structure for raw files:
    - **GitLab:**  
      `https://company/git/my_repo/-/raw/main/dist/package.whl`
    - **Bitbucket:**  
      `https://company/git/my_repo/raw/refs/heads/main/dist/package.whl`
    - **GitHub Enterprise:**  
      `https://company/raw/git/my_repo/main/dist/package.whl`

---

### **Best Workaround: Use `find-links` with a Simple HTTP Server**
If `pip install` keeps failing:
1. **Host the `.whl` on a simple HTTP server** (Python built-in):
   ```bash
   cd dist && python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. **Install with `--find-links`**:
   ```bash
   pip install --find-links=http://localhost:8000 my_package
   ```

---

### **Permanent Solution: Use a Private PyPI Server**
Instead of Git, host your wheels on:
- **DevPI** (lightweight)
- **Artifactory** (enterprise)
- **GitHub Packages** / **GitLab Package Registry**

Then install with:
```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://__token__:mytoken@company.com/api/pypi my_package
```

---

### **Debugging Steps**
1. **Check if the URL works**:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/package.whl
   ```
2. **Test with `wget`**:
   ```bash
   wget --user=username --password=password https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/package.whl
   ```
3. **Use `pip -v` for verbose logs**:
   ```bash
   pip install -v https://company/git/my_repo/raw/main/dist/package.whl
   ```

If you still face issues, share:
- The **exact error message**
- Whether you’re using **GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket**
- Your **network environment** (corporate VPN?)

## User

we use azure devops, i think

---

## Assistant

Since you're using **Azure DevOps (ADO)**, the correct way to install a Python wheel (`*.whl`) from a private repository involves using **Azure Artifacts** (ADO's package management system). Here’s how to do it properly:

---

### **Option 1: Install from Azure Artifacts (Recommended)**
#### **Step 1: Set Up Authentication**
1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
    - Go to `https://dev.azure.com/your-org/_usersSettings/tokens`
    - Create a new PAT with **"Packaging: Read"** scope.

2. **Configure pip to use the PAT**:
   ```bash
   pip install -U pip
   pip install keyring artifacts-keyring  # Azure DevOps authentication helper
   ```

#### **Step 2: Install the Wheel**
```bash
pip install --index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_packaging/your-feed-name/pypi/simple/ your-package
```
- Replace:
    - `your-org` → Azure DevOps organization name
    - `your-project` → Project name (if applicable)
    - `your-feed-name` → Name of your Azure Artifacts feed

#### **Alternative (Manual Auth)**
If `artifacts-keyring` doesn’t work:
```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://<username>:<PAT>@pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_packaging/your-feed-name/pypi/simple/ your-package
```

---

### **Option 2: Direct Download from ADO Git Repo (If Wheel is in `dist/`)**
If your wheel is in a Git repo (not recommended for production):
```bash
pip install "https://<username>:<PAT>@dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo/raw/main/dist/your-package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl?download=true"
```
- Replace:
    - `your-org`, `your-project`, `your-repo` → ADO repo details
    - `your-package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` → Exact wheel filename

---

### **Option 3: Clone the Repo & Install Locally**
```bash
git clone https://<username>:<PAT>@dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo
cd your-repo
pip install ./dist/your-package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

---

### **Troubleshooting**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Timeout** | Check if the URL is correct (ADO raw URLs require `?download=true`). |
| **Authentication Failed** | Use a PAT with `Packaging: Read` scope. |
| **Wrong Wheel** | Ensure the wheel matches your Python version/platform (`pip debug --verbose` to check compatibility). |

---

### **Best Practices for Azure DevOps**
1. **Publish Wheels to Azure Artifacts** (not Git):
   ```bash
   twine upload --repository-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_packaging/your-feed-name/pypi/upload/ dist/*
   ```
2. **Use CI/CD to Build Wheels Automatically**:
    - Add a `azure-pipelines.yml` task to build wheels for all platforms using `cibuildwheel`.

---

### **Verify Installation**
```bash
pip show your-package
```
Check the `Location` field to confirm the wheel was installed correctly.

## User

what is pat

---

## Assistant

A **PAT (Personal Access Token)** is a secure alternative to using passwords for authentication in Azure DevOps (and other services like GitHub/GitLab). It's a unique string of characters that grants specific permissions to access resources (like repositories, pipelines, or packages) without exposing your actual password.

---

### **Key Features of a PAT**
1. **Scoped Access**: You define what the token can do (e.g., read repositories, manage builds).
2. **Expiration**: Tokens can be set to expire after a certain time (e.g., 30 days).
3. **Revocable**: You can delete a PAT anytime to invalidate it.
4. **Per-User**: Tied to your account, not a shared password.

---

### **How to Create a PAT in Azure DevOps**
#### **Step-by-Step**
1. **Go to Azure DevOps**:
    - Navigate to:  
      `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization/_usersSettings/tokens`  
      (Replace `your-organization` with your actual org name.)

2. **Create a New Token**:
    - Click **"New Token"**.
    - Give it a name (e.g., `pip-install-token`).

3. **Set Expiration**:
    - Choose a duration (e.g., 30 days for short-term use, or 1 year for CI/CD).

4. **Select Scopes**:
    - For accessing packages (wheels), enable:
        - **"Packaging" → Read** (to download wheels).
        - If cloning repos is needed, add:  
          **"Code" → Read**.

5. **Generate the Token**:
    - Click **"Create"**.
    - **Copy the token immediately** (you won’t see it again!).

---

### **How to Use a PAT**
#### **1. For `pip` Installation**
```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://<anything>:<PAT>@pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_packaging/your-feed-name/pypi/simple/ your-package
```
- Replace:
    - `<PAT>` with your actual token.
    - `<anything>` can be a placeholder (e.g., `user`, `pat`). Only the token matters.

#### **2. For Git Repo Access**
```bash
git clone https://<anything>:<PAT>@dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo
```

#### **3. For `curl`/API Calls**
```bash
curl -u "user:<PAT>" https://dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_apis/pipelines
```

---

### **Security Best Practices**
1. **Never Hardcode PATs in Scripts**:  
   Use environment variables or secret managers (e.g., Azure Key Vault).
   ```bash
   export ADO_PAT="your-token"
   pip install --extra-index-url https://user:$ADO_PAT@pkgs.dev.azure.com/...
   ```

2. **Limit Token Scope**:  
   Only grant the minimum permissions needed (e.g., `Packaging: Read` for pip).

3. **Rotate Tokens Regularly**:  
   Revoke old tokens and generate new ones periodically.

4. **Use `artifacts-keyring` for Pip (Azure-Specific)**:
   ```bash
   pip install artifacts-keyring
   ```
   This avoids exposing the PAT in commands (uses secure storage).

---

### **Troubleshooting**
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **"Access Denied"** | Verify the PAT has the correct scopes (e.g., `Packaging: Read`). |
| **Token Expired** | Generate a new PAT in Azure DevOps. |
| **PAT Leaked** | Revoke it immediately under `_usersSettings/tokens`. |

---

### **Example: Full Pip Install with PAT**
```bash
pip install \
  --extra-index-url https://myuser:my-pat-123456@pkgs.dev.azure.com/acme/my-project/_packaging/my-feed/pypi/simple/ \
  my-package
```

## User

can i also use password

---

## Assistant

Yes, you **can** use your **Azure DevOps (ADO) password** instead of a PAT for authentication, but **it’s not recommended** for security reasons. Here’s how it works and why you should prefer PATs:

---

### **Option 1: Using Your ADO Password (Not Recommended)**
#### **For `pip` Installation**
```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://<your-email>:<your-password>@pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_packaging/your-feed/pypi/simple/ your-package
```
- Replace:
    - `<your-email>` → The email you use to log in to Azure DevOps.
    - `<your-password>` → Your ADO account password.
    - `your-org`, `your-project`, `your-feed` → Your Azure details.

#### **For Git Access**
```bash
git clone https://<your-email>:<your-password>@dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo
```

---

### **Why PATs Are Better Than Passwords**
| **Personal Access Token (PAT)** | **Password** |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| ✅ Limited permissions (e.g., only "Packaging: Read") | ❌ Full account access (if compromised) |
| ✅ Auto-expires after a set time | ❌ Works until manually changed |
| ✅ Revocable without changing your main password | ❌ Changing it requires resetting your ADO login |
| ✅ Works with `artifacts-keyring` for secure storage | ❌ Must be embedded in scripts/URLs |

---

### **When You *Might* Use a Password**
1. **Quick testing** (but switch to PATs afterward).
2. **Legacy systems** that don’t support PATs (rare).

---

### **Best Practice: Use PATs + `artifacts-keyring`**
1. **Install the Azure DevOps helper**:
   ```bash
   pip install artifacts-keyring
   ```
2. **Run `pip` without hardcoding credentials**:
   ```bash
   pip install --extra-index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_packaging/your-feed/pypi/simple/ your-package
   ```
    - `artifacts-keyring` will auto-handle authentication securely.

---

### **Security Warning**
- **Never commit passwords/PATs in code** (use `.env` files or secret managers).
- **Avoid passwords in URLs** (they may leak in logs):
  ```bash
  # BAD (password visible in shell history/logs)
  pip install https://user:password@dev.azure.com/...

  # GOOD (use PAT + keyring or env vars)
  export ADO_TOKEN="your-pat"
  pip install --extra-index-url https://user:$ADO_TOKEN@dev.azure.com/...
  ```

---

### **Troubleshooting Password Issues**
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"Access Denied"** | Ensure your account has permissions to the feed/repo. |
| **"Invalid Credentials"** | Use `dev.azure.com` (not `visualstudio.com`). |
| **2FA (MFA) Enabled** | You *must* use a PAT (passwords alone won’t work). |

---

### **Summary**
- **Can you use your password?** → Yes, but **don’t**.
- **Should you use a PAT?** → **Yes!** (More secure, controllable, and compliant with MFA.)

## User

can you give me all the detailed steps required to use azure devops to install the wheel from the repository in a dist folder using password and username?

---

## Assistant

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to install a Python wheel (`.whl`) from an **Azure DevOps (ADO) repository** using **username/password** authentication:

---

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Access to the ADO repository** containing the `dist/` folder with the wheel.
2. **Username and password** for your Azure DevOps account.
3. **Direct raw URL** to the `.whl` file (check the exact path in your repository).

---

### **Step 1: Get the Raw URL to the Wheel File**
1. Navigate to your repository in Azure DevOps:
   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_git/{repo-name}
   ```
2. Go to the `dist/` folder and locate your `.whl` file.
3. Click the file → Select **"Raw"** (top-right corner).
4. Copy the URL. It should look like:
   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_git/{repo-name}/raw?path=dist/package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Install the Wheel Using `pip`**
Run the following command, replacing placeholders with your details:
```bash
pip install "https://{username}:{password}@dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_git/{repo-name}/raw?path=dist/package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl"
```

#### **Notes**:
- **Enclose the URL in quotes** (`"..."`) to avoid shell issues.
- If your password contains special characters (e.g., `@`, `#`), **URL-encode** them (e.g., `@` → `%40`).
- For **corporate networks**, you may need a proxy:
  ```bash
  pip install --proxy=http://user:pass@proxy-server:port "https://user:pass@dev.azure.com/..."
  ```

---

### **Step 3: Verify Installation**
Check if the package installed correctly:
```bash
pip show package-name
```
- Look for the `Location` field to confirm the wheel was used.

---

### **Troubleshooting**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Timeout** | Check network/firewall settings. Use `curl -v URL` to test access. |
| **Authentication Failed** | Verify username/password. Use a **PAT** if MFA is enabled. |
| **"Invalid Wheel"** | Ensure the wheel matches your Python version/platform (`pip debug --verbose`). |
| **URL Not Found** | Confirm the raw path is correct (case-sensitive). |

---

### **Security Warning**
- **Avoid hardcoding passwords** in scripts/terminals. Use:
    - **Environment variables**:
      ```bash
      export ADO_USER="your-username"
      export ADO_PASS="your-password"
      pip install "https://$ADO_USER:$ADO_PASS@dev.azure.com/..."
      ```
    - **`.netrc` file** (safer):
      ```bash
      echo "machine dev.azure.com login your-username password your-password" >> ~/.netrc
      chmod 600 ~/.netrc
      pip install "https://dev.azure.com/..."
      ```

---

### **Recommended Alternative: Use a PAT**
If possible, **replace passwords with a PAT** (Personal Access Token):
1. Generate a PAT with **"Code: Read"** and **"Packaging: Read"** scopes.
2. Use:
   ```bash
   pip install "https://anything:{PAT}@dev.azure.com/..."
   ```

---

### **Full Example**
```bash
# Install wheel using username/password
pip install "https://john.doe%40company.com:MyP%40ssword123@dev.azure.com/acme/project1/_git/repo1/raw?path=dist/mypkg-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl"

# Verify
pip show mypkg
```
